        <h2>About this game</h2>
        <p class="description">
            This memory game is based on Pokemon! Match pokemon to collect them and watch your pokedex progress on the right.
            I originally went with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc5YFrh8mVM">Route 47</a> music for the
            background music, but it ended up being a little too stirring for a memory match game, so I went with the rather
            relaxing music from Azalea Town (the OG version from Gen 2!). The rest of the sound effects are from the Gen 3 and 4 games.
